            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p> Hi, my name is Hassan Adegoke. 
                I was born in Nigeria and moved to America when I was three years old. My early experiences instilled in me a strong sense of resilience and adaptability, which have become integral to who I am today. Growing up in a household of eight, I learned the value of hard work, sacrifice, and the importance of supporting my family, both here and in Nigeria. Despite the challenges, I’ve always had a keen interest in science, driven by a desire to understand the world around me and a natural curiosity that kept me engaged. 
                
                I played many sports in highschool but out of all of them football stood out the most. Despite me only playing it for one season it taught me invaluable lessons about teamwork, resilience, and the power of a supportive community. Unlike other sports I had played, football required a level of collaboration that went beyond individual talent. Our team's success depended on every player's contribution, and this collective responsibility fostered a sense of family among us. The challenges we faced together, both on and off the field, taught me that the strongest force in the universe is a group of people striving towards a common goal. This experience has profoundly influenced the way I approach collaboration, making it almost impossible for me not to create meaningful connections with those I work with.
                
                Living with ADHD, my mind is constantly exploring different possibilities, which sometimes makes it difficult to stay on task. However, this trait has also been my greatest asset, allowing me to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to problems. My favorite word, “Goke,” which means to ascend in English, encapsulates my approach to life. It represents my constant drive for growth and improvement, both personally and professionally. Inspired by this ethos, I am passionate about starting my own computer science startup, combining my love for technology and entertainment to create something impactful. 
                
                My github username isTheCrimsonDragonx, the reason why I named it that is because it has been my name for a very long time, so it’s easy to remember.
